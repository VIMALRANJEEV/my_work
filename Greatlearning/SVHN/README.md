ABOUT THE DATASET

SVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing machine learning and object recognition algorithms with the minimal requirement on data formatting but comes from a significantly harder, unsolved, real-world problem (recognizing digits and numbers in natural scene images). SVHN is obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images.

The dataset consists of 73,257 digits for training and 26,032 digits for testing. It also comes with an additional 531,131 somewhat less difficult samples that can be used as extra training data. It is recommended to use the full dataset (630K images) when evaluating algorithms as it is common practice in the majority of the literature.
